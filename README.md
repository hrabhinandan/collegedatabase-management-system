# College Database System

This is a Java app which uses MySQL to manage core tasks in a college like viewing students' data, calculating GPA per semester, grading, checking scores per subject for faculties etc.

SQL concepts that are used:
1. Basic operations: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, JOIN
2. Clauses: WHERE, AND, GROUP BY, HAVING etc
3. Operations on tables: CREATE, ALTER, Foreign Key Constraints
4. Triggers, Stored Procedures
5. Indexes


# Running the application

## Set up the database

> **Note:** You must have MySQL server and client installed on your PC.

Open the MySQL console, and create an empty database `collegedatabase`. You can use the command
`create database collegedatabase;`
`use collegedatabase;`

# Troubleshooting

- If your get an access denied error, make sure the username and password for your MySQL server are correct. The default username is `root` and there is no password. You might need to change these values in `Main.java`. Or you can follow this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@chiragpatel_52497/solved-error-access-denied-for-user-root-localhost-of-mysql-programming-school-6e3611838d06).
